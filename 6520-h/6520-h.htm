  <H2>THE HOME</H2>
  <P class=L>I PACED alone on the road across the field while the sunset was
  hiding its last gold like a miser. </P>
  <P>The daylight sank deeper and deeper into the darkness, and the widowed
  land, whose harvest had been reaped, lay silent. </P>
  <P>Suddenly a boy's shrill voice rose into the sky. He traversed the dark
  unseen, leaving the track of his song across the hush of the evening. </P>
  <P>His village home lay there at the end of the waste land, beyond the
  sugar-cane field, hidden among the shadows of the banana and the slender areca
  palm, the cocoa-nut and the dark green jack-fruit trees. </P>
  <P>I stopped for a moment in my lonely way under the starlight, and saw spread
  before me the darkened earth surrounding with her arms
  countless homes furnished with cradles and beds, mothers' hearts and evening
  lamps, and young lives glad with a gladness that knows nothing of its value
  for the world. </P>

<A name=seashore></A>
  <H2>ON THE SEASHORE</H2>
  <P class=L>ON the seashore of endless worlds children meet. </P>
  <P>The infinite sky is motionless overhead and the restless water is
  boisterous. On the seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts
  and dances. </P>

  <P>They build their houses with sand, and they play with empty shells. With
  withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast
  deep. Children have their play on the seashore of worlds. </P>

  <P>They know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. Pearl-fishers
  dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while children gather pebbles
  and scatter them again. They seek not for hidden treasures,
  they know not how to cast nets. </P>

  <P>The sea surges up with laughter, and pale gleams the smile of the
  sea-beach. Death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children, even
  like a mother while rocking her baby's cradle. The sea plays with children,
  and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach. </P>

  <P>On the seashore of endless worlds children meet. Tempest roams in the
  pathless sky, ships are wrecked in the trackless water, death is abroad and
  children play. On the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of
  children. </P>

<A name=source></A>
  <H2>THE SOURCE</H2>
  <P class=L>THE sleep that flits on baby's eyes--does anybody know from where
  it comes? Yes, there is a rumour that it has its dwelling where, in the fairy
  village among shadows of the forest dimly lit with glow-worms, there hang two
  shy buds of enchantment. From there it comes to kiss baby's eyes. </P>
  <P>The smile that flickers on baby's lips when he sleeps--does anybody know
  where it was born? Yes, there is a rumour that a young pale beam of a crescent
  moon touched the edge of a vanishing autumn cloud, and there the smile was
  first born in the dream of a dew-washed morning--the smile that flickers on
  baby's lips when he sleeps. </P>
  <P>The sweet, soft freshness that blooms on baby's limbs--does anybody know
  where it was hidden so long? Yes, when the mother was a young
  girl it lay pervading her heart in tender and silent mystery of love--the
  sweet, soft freshness that has bloomed on baby's limbs. </P>

<A name=bway></A>
  <H2>BABY'S WAY</H2>
  <P class=L>IF baby only wanted to, he could fly up to heaven this moment. </P>
  <P>It is not for nothing that he does not leave us. </P>
  <P>He loves to rest his head on mother's bosom, and cannot ever bear to lose
  sight of her. </P>

  <P>Baby knows all manner of wise words, though few on earth can understand
  their meaning. </P>
  <P>It is not for nothing that he never wants to speak. </P>
  <P>The one thing he wants is to learn mother's words from mother's lips. That
  is why he looks so innocent. </P>

  <P>Baby had a heap of gold and pearls, yet he came like a beggar on to this
  earth. </P>
  <P>It is not for nothing he came in such a disguise. </P>
  <P>This dear little naked mendicant pretends to be utterly helpless, so that
  he may beg for mother's wealth of love. </P>

  <P>Baby was so free from every tie in the land of the tiny crescent moon. </P>
  <P>It was not for nothing he gave up his freedom. </P>
  <P>He knows that there is room for endless joy in mother's little corner of a
  heart, and it is sweeter far than liberty to be caught and pressed in her dear
  arms. </P>

  <P>Baby never knew how to cry. He dwelt in the land of perfect bliss. </P>
  <P>It is not for nothing he has chosen to shed tears. </P>
  <P>Though with the smile of his dear face he draws mother's yearning heart to
  him, yet his little cries over tiny troubles weave the double bond of pity and
  love. </P>

<A name=pageant></A>
  <H2>THE UNHEEDED PAGEANT</H2>
  <P class=L>AH, who was it coloured that little frock, my child, and covered
  your sweet limbs with that little red tunic? </P>
  <P>You have come out in the morning to play in the courtyard, tottering and
  tumbling as you run. </P>
  <P>But who was it coloured that little frock, my child? </P>

  <P>What is it makes you laugh, my little life-bud? </P>
  <P>Mother smiles at you standing on the threshold. </P>
  <P>She claps her hands and her bracelets jingle, and you dance with your
  bamboo stick in your hand like a tiny little shepherd. </P>
  <P>But what is it makes you laugh, my little life-bud? </P>

  <P>O beggar, what do you beg for, clinging to your mother's neck with both
  your hands? </P>
  <P>O greedy heart, shall I pluck the world like a fruit from the sky to place
  it on your little rosy palm? </P>
  <P>O beggar, what are you begging for? </P>
  <P>The wind carries away in glee the tinkling of your anklet bells. </P>
  <P>The sun smiles and watches your toilet. The sky watches over you when you
  sleep in your mother's arms, and the morning comes tiptoe to your bed and
  kisses your eyes. </P>
  <P>The wind carries away in glee the tinkling of your anklet bells. </P>

  <P>The fairy mistress of dreams is coming towards you, flying through the
  twilight sky. </P>
  <P>The world-mother keeps her seat by you in your mother's heart. </P>
  <P>He who plays his music to the stars is standing at your window with his
  flute. </P>
  <P>And the fairy mistress of dreams is coming towards you, flying through the
  twilight sky. </P>

<A name=sleepstealer></A>
  <H2>SLEEP-STEALER</H2>
  <P class=L>WHO stole sleep from baby's eyes? I must know. </P>
  <P>Clasping her pitcher to her waist mother went to fetch water from the
  village near by. </P>
  <P>It was noon. The children's playtime was over; the ducks in the pond were
  silent. </P>
  <P>The shepherd boy lay asleep under the shadow of the <I>banyan</I> tree.
</P>
  <P>The crane stood grave and still in the swamp near the mango grove. </P>
  <P>In the meanwhile the Sleep-stealer came and, snatching sleep from baby's
  eyes, flew away. </P>
  <P>When mother came back she found baby travelling the room over on all fours.
  </P>
  <P>Who stole sleep from our baby's eyes? I must know. I must find her and
  chain her up. </P>
  <P>I must look into that dark cave, where, through boulders and scowling
  stones, trickles a tiny stream. </P>
  <P>I must search in the drowsy shade of the <I>bakula</I> grove, where pigeons
  coo in their corner, and fairies' anklets tinkle in the stillness of starry
  nights. </P>
  <P>In the evening I will peep into the whispering silence of the bamboo
  forest, where fireflies squander their light, and will ask every creature I
  meet, "Can anybody tell me where the Sleep-stealer lives?" </P>
  <P>Who stole sleep from baby's eyes? I must know. </P>
  <P>Shouldn't I give her a good lesson if I could only catch her! </P>
  <P>I would raid her nest and see where she hoards all her stolen sleep. </P>
  <P>I would plunder it all, and carry it home. </P>
  <P>I would bind her two wings securely, set her on the bank of the river, and
  then let her play at fishing with a reed among the rushes and water-lilies.
  </P>
  <P>When the marketing is over in the evening, and the village children sit in
  their mothers' laps, then the night birds will mockingly din her ears with:
  </P>
  <P>"Whose sleep will you steal now?" </P>

  <H2>THE BEGINNING</H2>
  <P class=L>"WHERE have I come from, where did you pick me up?" the baby asked
  its mother. </P>
  <P>She answered half crying, half laughing, and clasping the baby to her
  breast,-- "You were hidden in my heart as its desire, my darling. </P>
  <P>You were in the dolls of my childhood's games; and when with clay I made
  the image of my god every morning, I made and unmade you then. </P>
  <P>You were enshrined with our household deity, in his worship I worshipped
  you. </P>
  <P>In all my hopes and my loves, in my life, in the life of my mother you have
  lived. </P>
  <P>In the lap of the deathless Spirit who rules our home you have been nursed
  for ages. </P>
  <P>When in girlhood my heart was opening its petals, you hovered as a
  fragrance about it. </P>
  <P>Your tender softness bloomed in my youthful limbs, like a glow in the sky
  before the sunrise. </P>
  <P>Heaven's first darling, twin-born with the morning light, you have floated
  down the stream of the world's life, and at last you have stranded on my
  heart. </P>
  <P>As I gaze on your face, mystery overwhelms me; you who belong to all have
  become mine. </P>
  <P>For fear of losing you I hold you tight to my breast. What magic has snared
  the world's treasure in these slender arms of mine?" </P>

<A name=bworld></A>
  <H2>BABY'S WORLD</H2>
  <P class=L>I WISH I could take a quiet corner in the heart of my baby's very
  own world. </P>
  <P>I know it has stars that talk to him, and a sky that stoops down to his
  face to amuse him with its silly clouds and rainbows. </P>
  <P>Those who make believe to be dumb, and look as if they never could move,
  come creeping to his window with their stories and with trays crowded with
  bright toys. </P>
  <P>I wish I could travel by the road that crosses baby's mind, and out beyond
  all bounds; </P>
  <P>Where messengers run errands for no cause between the kingdoms of kings of
  no history; </P>
  <P>Where Reason makes kites of her laws and flies them, and Truth sets Fact
  free from its fetters. </P>

<A name=whenwhy></A>
  <H2>WHEN AND WHY</H2>
  <P class=L>WHEN I bring you coloured toys, my child, I understand why there is
  such a play of colours on clouds, on water, and why flowers are painted in
  tints--when I give coloured toys to you, my child. </P>
  <P>When I sing to make you dance, I truly know why there is music in leaves,
  and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart of the listening
  earth--when I sing to make you dance. </P>
  <P>When I bring sweet things to your greedy hands, I know why there is honey
  in the cup of the flower, and why fruits are secretly filled with sweet
  juice--when I bring sweet things to your greedy hands. </P>
  <P>When I kiss your face to make you smile, my darling, I surely understand
  what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light, and what
  delight the summer breeze brings to my body--when I kiss you to make you
  smile. </P>

<A name=defamation></A>
  <H2>DEFAMATION</H2>
  <P class=L>WHY are those tears in your eyes, my child? </P>
  <P>How horrid of them to be always scolding you for nothing? </P>
  <P>You have stained your fingers and face with ink while writing--is that why
  they call you dirty? </P>
  <P>O, fie! Would they dare to call the full moon dirty because it has smudged
  its face with ink? </P>

  <P>For every little trifle they blame you, my child. They are ready to find
  fault for nothing. </P>
  <P>You tore your clothes while playing--is that why they call you untidy? </P>
  <P>O, fie! What would they call an autumn morning that smiles
  through its ragged clouds? </P>

  <P>Take no heed of what they say to you, my child. </P>
  <P>Take no heed of what they say to you, my child. </P>
  <P>They make a long list of your misdeeds. Everybody knows how you love sweet
  things--is that why they call you greedy? </P>
  <P>O, fie! What then would they call us who love you? </P>

<A name=judge></A>
  <H2>THE JUDGE</H2>
  <P class=L>SAY of him what you please, but I know my child's failings. </P>
  <P>I do not love him because he is good, but because he is my little child.
  </P>
  <P>How should you know how dear he can be when you try to weigh his merits
  against his faults? </P>
  <P>When I must punish him he becomes all the more a part of my being. </P>
  <P>When I cause his tears to come my heart weeps with him. </P>
  <P>I alone have a right to blame and punish, for he only may chastise who
  loves. </P>

<A name=playthings></A>
  <H2>PLAYTHINGS</H2>
  <P class=L>CHILD, how happy you are sitting in the dust, playing with a broken
  twig all the morning. </P>
  <P>I smile at your play with that little bit of a broken twig. </P>
  <P>I am busy with my accounts, adding up figures by the hour. </P>
  <P>Perhaps you glance at me and think, "What a stupid game to spoil your
  morning with!" </P>
  <P>Child, I have forgotten the art of being absorbed in sticks and mud-pies.
  </P>
  <P>I seek out costly playthings, and gather lumps of gold and silver. </P>
  <P>With whatever you find you create your glad games, I spend both my time and
  my strength over things I never can obtain. </P>
  <P>In my frail canoe I struggle to cross the sea of desire, and forget that I
  too am playing a game. </P>

<A name=astro></A>
  <H2>THE ASTRONOMER</H2>
  <P class=L>I ONLY said, "When in the evening the round full moon gets
  entangled among the branches of that <I>Kadam</I> tree, couldn't somebody
  catch it?" </P>
  <P>But dâdâ [<I>elder brother</I>] laughed at me and said, "Baby, you are the
  silliest child I have ever known. The moon is ever so far from us, how could
  anybody catch it?" </P>
  <P>I said, "Dâdâ how foolish you are! When mother looks out of her window and
  smiles down at us playing, would you call her far away?" </P>
  <P>Still said, "You are a stupid child! But, baby, where could you find a net
  big enough to catch the moon with?" </P>
  <P>I said, "Surely you could catch it with your hands." </P>
  <P>But dâdâ laughed and said, "You are the silliest child I have known. If it
  came nearer, you would see how big the moon is." </P>
  <P>I said, "Dâdâ, what nonsense they teach at your school! When mother bends
  her face down to kiss us does her face look very big?" </P>
  <P>But still dâdâ says, "You are a stupid child." </P>

<A name=clouds></A>
  <H2>CLOUDS AND WAVES</H2>
  <P class=L>MOTHER, the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me-- </P>
  <P>"We play from the time we wake till the day ends. </P>
  <P>We play with the golden dawn, we play with the silver moon. </P>
  <P>I ask, "But, how am I to get up to you?" They answer, "Come to the edge of
  the earth, lift up your hands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the
  clouds." </P>
  <P>"My mother is waiting for me at home," I say. "How can I leave her and
  come?" </P>
  <P>Then they smile and float away. </P>
  <P>But I know a nicer game than that, mother. </P>
  <P>I shall be the cloud and you the moon. </P>
  <P>I shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top will be the blue
  sky. </P>
  <P>The folk who live in the waves call out to me-- </P>
  <P>"We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and know not where we
  pass." </P>
  <P>I ask, "But, how am I to join you?" They tell me, "Come to the edge of the
  shore and stand with your eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon
  the waves." </P>
  <P>I say, "My mother always wants me at home in the evening--how can I leave

  <P>Then they smile, dance and pass by. </P>
  <P>But I know a better game than that. </P>
  <P>I will be the waves and you will be a strange shore. </P>
  <P>I shall roll on and on and on, and break upon your lap with laughter. </P>
  <P>And no one in the world will know where we both are. </P>

  <H2>THE CHAMPA FLOWER</H2>
  <P class=L>SUPPOSING I became a <I>champa</I> flower, just for fun, and grew
  on a branch high up that tree, and shook in the wind with laughter and danced
  upon the newly budded leaves, would you know me, mother? </P>
  <P>You would call, "Baby, where are you?" and I should laugh to myself and
  keep quite quiet. </P>
  <P>I should slyly open my petals and watch you at your work. </P>
  <P>When after your bath, with wet hair spread on your shoulders, you walked
  through the shadow of the <I>champa</I> tree to the little court where you say
  your prayers, you would notice the scent of the flower, but not know that it
  came from me. </P>
  <P>When after the midday meal you sat at the window reading
  <CITE>Ramayana,</CITE> and the tree's shadow fell over your hair and your lap,
  I should fling my wee little shadow on to the page of your book, just where
  you were reading. </P>
  <P>But would you guess that it was the tiny shadow of your little child? </P>
  <P>When in the evening you went to the cow-shed with the lighted lamp in your
  hand, I should suddenly drop on to the earth again and be your own baby once
  more, and beg you to tell me a story. </P>
  <P>"Where have you been, you naughty child?" </P>
  <P>"I won't tell you, mother." That's what you and I would say then. </P>

  <H2>FAIRYLAND</H2>
  <P class=L>IF people came to know where my king's palace is, it would vanish
  into the air. </P>
  <P>The walls are of white silver and the roof of shining gold. </P>
  <P>The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and she wears a jewel
  that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms. </P>
  <P>But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king's palace is. </P>
  <P>It is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the <I>tulsi</I> plant
  stands. </P>

  <P>The princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the seven impassable
  seas. </P>
  <P>There is none in the world who can find her but myself. </P>
  <P>She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears;
  her hair sweeps down upon the floor. </P>
  <P>She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand, and jewels will fall
  from her lips when she smiles. </P>
  <P>But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the corner of our
  terrace where the pot of the <I>tulsi</I> plant stands. </P>

  <P>When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step up to that
  terrace on the roof. </P>
  <P>I sit in the corner where the shadows of the walls meet together. </P>
  <P>Only puss is allowed to come with me, for she knows where the barber in the
  story lives. </P>
  <P>But let me whisper, mother, in your ear where the barber in the story
  lives. </P>
  <P>It is at the corner of the terrace where the pot of the <I>tulsi</I> plant

<A name=landexile></A>
  <H2>THE LAND OF THE EXILE</H2>
  <P class=L>MOTHER, the light has grown grey in the sky; I do not know what the
  time is. </P>
  <P>There is no fun in my play, so I have come to you. It is Saturday, our
  holiday. </P>
  <P>Leave off your work, mother; sit here by the window and tell me where the
  desert of Tepântar in the fairy tale is? </P>

  <P>The shadow of the rains has covered the day from end to end. </P>
  <P>The fierce lightning is scratching the sky with its nails. </P>
  <P>When the clouds rumble and it thunders, I love to be afraid in my heart and
  cling to you. </P>
  <P>When the heavy rain patters for hours on the bamboo leaves, and our windows
  shake and rattle at the gusts of wind, I like to sit alone in
  the room, mother, with you, and hear you talk about the desert of Tepântar in
  the fairy tale. </P>

  <P>Where is it, mother, on the shore of what sea, at the foot of what hills,
  in the kingdom of what king? </P>
  <P>There are no hedges there to mark the fields, no footpath across it by
  which the villagers reach their village in the evening, or the woman who
  gathers dry sticks in the forest can bring her load to the market. With
  patches of yellow grass in the sand and only one tree where the pair of wise
  old birds have their nest, lies the desert of Tepântar. </P>

  <P>I can imagine how, on just such a cloudy day, the young son of the king is
  riding alone on a grey horse through the desert, in search of the princess who
  lies imprisoned in the giant's palace across that unknown water. </P>
  <P>When the haze of the rain comes down in the distant sky, and lightning
  starts up like a sudden fit of pain, does he remember his unhappy mother,
  abandoned by the king, sweeping the cow-stall and wiping her eyes, while he
  rides through the desert of Tepântar in the fairy tale? </P>

  <P>See, mother, it is almost dark before the day is over, and there are no
  travellers yonder on the village road. </P>
  <P>The shepherd boy has gone home early from the pasture, and men have left
  their fields to sit on mats under the eaves of their huts, watching the
  scowling clouds. </P>
  <P>Mother, I have left all my books on the shelf--do not ask me to do my
  lessons now. </P>
  <P>When I grow up and am big like my father, I shall learn all that must be
  learnt. </P>
  <P>But just for to-day, tell me, mother, where the desert of Tepântar in the
  fairy tale is? </P>

<A name=rainyday></A>
  <H2>THE RAINY DAY</H2>
  <P class=L>SULLEN clouds are gathering fast over the black fringe of the
  forest. </P>
  <P>O child, do not go out! </P>
  <P>The palm trees in a row by the lake are smiting their heads against the
  dismal sky; the crows with their draggled wings are silent on the tamarind
  branches, and the eastern bank of the river is haunted by a deepening gloom.
  </P>

  <P>Our cow is lowing loud, tied at the fence. </P>
  <P>O child, wait here till I bring her into the stall. </P>
  <P>Men have crowded into the flooded field to catch the fishes as they escape
  from the overflowing ponds; the rain water is running in rills through the
  narrow lanes like a laughing boy who has run away from his
  mother to tease her. </P>

  <P>Listen, someone is shouting for the boatman at the ford. </P>
  <P>O child, the daylight is dim, and the crossing at the ferry is closed. </P>
  <P>The sky seems to ride fast upon the madly-rushing rain; the water in the
  river is loud and impatient; women have hastened home early from the Ganges
  with their filled pitchers. </P>

  <P>The evening lamps must be made ready. </P>
  <P>O child, do not go out! </P>
  <P>The road to the market is desolate, the lane to the river is slippery. The
  wind is roaring and struggling among the bamboo branches like a wild beast
  tangled in a net. </P>

  <H2>PAPER BOATS</H2>
  <P class=L>DAY by day I float my paper boats one by one down the running
  stream. </P>
  <P>In big black letters I write my name on them and the name of the village
  where I live. </P>
  <P>I hope that someone in some strange land will find them and know who I am.
  </P>
  <P>I load my little boats with <I>shiuli</I> flowers from our garden, and hope
  that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land in the night.
</P>
  <P>I launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the little clouds
  setting their white bulging sails. </P>
  <P>I know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down the air to race
  with my boats! </P>
  <P>When night comes I bury my face in my arms and dream that my paper boats
  float on and on under the midnight stars. </P>
  <P>The fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the lading is their baskets

  <H2>THE SAILOR</H2>
  <P class=L>THE boat of the boatman Madhu is moored at the wharf of Rajgunj.
  </P>
  <P>It is uselessly laden with jute, and has been lying there idle for ever so
  long. </P>
  <P>If he would only lend me his boat, I should man her with a hundred oars,
  and hoist sails, five or six or seven. </P>
  <P>I should never steer her to stupid markets. I should sail the seven seas
  and the thirteen rivers of fairyland. </P>

  <P>But, mother, you won't weep for me in a corner. </P>
  <P>I am not going into the forest like Ramachandra to come back only after
  fourteen years. </P>
  <P>I shall become the prince of the story, and fill my boat with whatever I
  like. </P>
  <P>I shall take my friend Ashu with me. We shall sail merrily across the seven
  seas and the thirteen rivers of fairyland. </P>

  <P>We shall set sail in the early morning light. </P>
  <P>When at noontide you are bathing at the pond, we shall be in the land of a
  strange king. </P>
  <P>We shall pass the ford of Tirpurni, and leave behind us the desert of
  Tepântar. </P>
  <P>When we come back it will be getting dark, and I shall tell you of all that
  we have seen. </P>
  <P>I shall cross the seven seas and the thirteen rivers of fairyland. </P>

  <H2>THE FURTHER BANK</H2>
  <P class=L>I LONG to go over there to the further bank of the river, </P>
  <P>Where those boats are tied to the bamboo poles in a line; </P>
  <P>Where men cross over in their boats in the morning with ploughs on their
  shoulders to till their far-away fields; </P>
  <P>Where the cowherds make their lowing cattle swim across to the riverside
  pasture; </P>
  <P>Whence they all come back home in the evening, leaving the jackals to howl
  in the island overgrown with weeds, </P>
  <P>Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman of the ferry
  when I am grown up. </P>
  <P>They say there are strange pools hidden behind that high bank, </P>
  <P>Where flocks of wild ducks come when the rains are over, and thick reeds
  grow round the margins where waterbirds lay their eggs; </P>
  <P>Where snipes with their dancing tails stamp their tiny footprints upon the
  clean soft mud; </P>
  <P>Where in the evening the tall grasses crested with white flowers invite the
  moonbeam to float upon their waves. </P>
  <P>Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman of the
  ferryboat when I am grown up. </P>

  <P>I shall cross and cross back from bank to bank, and all the boys and girls
  of the village will wonder at me while they are bathing. </P>
  <P>When the sun climbs the mid sky and morning wears on to noon, I shall come
  running to you, saying, "Mother, I am hungry!" </P>
  <P>When the day is done and the shadows cower under the trees,
  I shall come back in the dusk. </P>
  <P>I shall never go away from you into the town to work like father. </P>

  among the bamboos. </P>
  <P>Then crowds of flowers come out of a sudden, from nobody knows where, and
  dance upon the grass in wild glee. </P>

  <P>Mother, I really think the flowers go to school underground. </P>
  <P>They do their lessons with doors shut, and if they want to come out to play
  before it is time, their master makes them stand in a corner. </P>

  <P>When the rains come they have their holidays. </P>
  <P>Branches clash together in the forest, and the leaves rustle in the wild
  wind, the thunder-clouds clap their giant hands and the flower children rush
  out in dresses of pink and yellow and white. </P>

  <P>Do you know, mother, their home is in the sky, where the stars are. </P>
  <P>Haven't you seen how eager they are to get there? Don't you know why they
  are in such a hurry? </P>
  <P>Of course, I can guess to whom they raise their arms: they have their
  mother as I have my own. </P>

  <P>There, by the banks of golden streams, fields are full of golden harvest.
  </P>
  <P>And in the shade of the forest path the golden <I>champa</I> flowers drop
  on the ground. </P>
  <P>I will gather them all for you in many hundred baskets. </P>

  <P>Mother, do you want pearls big as the raindrops of autumn? </P>
  <P>I shall cross to the pearl island shore. There in the early morning light
  pearls tremble on the meadow flowers, pearls drop on the grass, and pearls are
  scattered on the sand in spray by the wild sea-waves. </P>
  <P>My brother shall have a pair of horses with wings to fly among the clouds.

  <P>Would you shake your finger at me and say, "What an ungrateful wretch of a

  <P>When I open a book before her and ask her to learn her a, b, c, she tears

  <P>Everybody knows that father is away, but if in play I call aloud "Father,"

  <P>My master will wonder and say, "He can leave his books if he likes, for he

  <P>I can easily imagine now that the sun has reached the edge of that

  <P>I can just shut my eyes and think that the shadows are growing darker under
  the <I>madar</I> tree, and the water in the pond looks shiny black. </P>

  <P>Did he never hear from his own mother stories of giants and fairies and

  <P>Has he forgotten them all? </P>

  <P>Often when he gets late for his bath you have to go and call him an hundred

  <P>Father always plays at making books. </P>
  <P>If ever I go to play in father's room, you come and call
  me, "what a naughty child!" </P>
  <P>If I make the slightest noise, you say, "Don't you see that father's at his
  work?" </P>
  <P>What's the fun of always writing and writing? </P>

  <P>When I take up father's pen or pencil and write upon his book just as he
  does,--a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i,--why do you get cross with me, then, mother?
  </P>
  <P>You never say a word when father writes. </P>

  <P>When my father wastes such heaps of paper, mother, you don't seem to mind
  at all. </P>
  <P>But if I take only one sheet to make a boat with, you say, "Child, how
  troublesome you are!" </P>

  <H2>THE WICKED POSTMAN</H2>
  <P class=L>WHY do you sit there on the floor so quiet and silent, tell me,

  <P>The rain is coming in through the open window, making you all wet, and you
  don't mind it. </P>
  <P>Do you hear the gong striking four? It is time for my brother to come home
  from school. </P>
  <P>What has happened to you that you look so strange? </P>
  <P>Haven't you got a letter from father to-day? </P>
  <P>I saw the postman bringing letters in his bag for almost everybody in the
  town. </P>
  <P>Only, father's letters he keeps to read himself. I am sure the postman is a
  wicked man. </P>
  <P>But don't be unhappy about that, mother dear. </P>
  <P>To-morrow is market day in the next village. You ask your maid to buy some
  pens and papers. </P>
  <P>I myself will write all father's letters; you will not find a single
  mistake. </P>
  <P>I shall write from A right up to K. </P>
  <P>But, mother, why do you smile? </P>
  <P>You don't believe that I can write as nicely as father does! </P>
  <P>But I shall rule my paper carefully, and write all the letters beautifully
  big. </P>
  <P>When I finish my writing, do you think I shall be so foolish as father and
  drop it into the horrid postman's bag? </P>
  <P>I shall bring it to you myself without waiting, and letter by letter help
  you to read my writing. </P>
  <P>I know the postman does not like to give you the really nice letters.

  <H2>THE HERO</H2>
  <P class=L>MOTHER, let us imagine we are travelling, and passing through a
  strange and dangerous country. </P>
  <P>You are riding in a palanquin and I am trotting by you on a red horse. </P>
  <P>It is evening and the sun goes down. The waste of <I>Joradighi</I> lies wan
  and grey before us. The land is desolate and barren. </P>
  <P>You are frightened and thinking--"I know not where we have come to." </P>
  <P>I say to you, "Mother, do not be afraid." </P>

  <P>The meadow is prickly with spiky grass, and through it runs a narrow broken
  path. </P>
  <P>There are no cattle to be seen in the wide field; they have gone to their
  village stalls. </P>
  <P>It grows dark and dim on the land and sky, and we cannot tell where we are
  going. </P>
  <P>Suddenly you call me and ask me in a whisper, "What light is that near the
  bank?" </P>

  <P>Just then there bursts out a fearful yell, and figures come running towards
  us. </P>
  <P>You sit crouched in your palanquin and repeat the names of the gods in
  prayer. </P>
  <P>The bearers, shaking in terror, hide themselves in the thorny bush. </P>
  <P>I shout to you, "Don't be afraid, mother. I am here." </P>

  <P>With long sticks in their hands and hair all wild about their heads, they
  come nearer and nearer. </P>
  <P>I shout, "Have a care! you villains! One step more and you are dead men."
  </P>
  <P>They give another terrible yell and rush forward. </P>
  <P>You clutch my hand and say, "Dear boy, for heaven's sake, keep away from
  them." </P>
  <P>I say, "Mother, just you watch me." </P>

  <P>Then I spur my horse for a wild gallop, and my sword and buckler clash
  against each other. </P>
  <P>The fight becomes so fearful, mother, that it would give you a cold shudder
  could you see it from your palanquin. </P>
  <P>Many of them fly, and a great number are cut to pieces. </P>
  <P>I know you are thinking, sitting all by yourself, that your boy must be
  dead by this time. </P>
  <P>But I come to you all stained with blood, and say, "Mother, the fight is
  over now." </P>
  <P>You come out and kiss me, pressing me to your heart, and you say to
  yourself, </P>
  <P>"I don't know what I should do if I hadn't my boy to escort me." </P>
  <P>A thousand useless things happen day after day, and why couldn't such a
  thing come true by chance? </P>
  <P>It would be like a story in a book. </P>
  <P>My brother would say, "Is it possible? I always thought he was so
  delicate!" </P>
  <P>Our village people would all say in amazement, "Was it not lucky that the
  boy was with his mother?" </P>

<A name=theend></A>
  <H2>THE END</H2>
  <P class=L>IT is time for me to go, mother; I am going. </P>
  <P>When in the paling darkness of the lonely dawn you stretch out your arms
  for your baby in the bed, I shall say, "Baby is not there!"--mother, I am
  going. </P>
  <P>I shall become a delicate draught of air and caress you; and I shall be
  ripples in the water when you bathe, and kiss you and kiss you again. </P>
  <P>In the gusty night when the rain patters on the leaves you will hear my
  whisper in your bed, and my laughter will flash with the lightning through the
  open window into your room. </P>
  <P>If you lie awake, thinking of your baby till late into the night, I shall
  sing to you from the stars, "Sleep mother, sleep." </P>
  <P>On the straying moonbeams I shall steal over your bed, and lie upon your
  bosom while you sleep. </P>
  <P>I shall become a dream, and through the little opening of your eyelids I
  shall slip into the depths of your sleep; and when you wake up and look round
  startled, like a twinkling firefly I shall flit out into the darkness. </P>
  <P>When, on the great festival of <I>puja,</I> the neighbours' children come
  and play about the house, I shall melt into the music of the flute and throb
  in your heart all day. </P>
  <P>Dear auntie will come with <I>puja</I>-presents and will ask, "Where is our
  baby, sister? Mother, you will tell her softly, "He is in the pupils of my
  eyes, he is in my body and in my soul." </P>

<A name=recall></A>
  <H2>THE RECALL</H2>
  <P class=L>THE night was dark when she went away, and they slept. </P>
  <P>The night is dark now, and I call for her, "Come back, my darling; the
  world is asleep; and no one would know, if you came for a moment while stars
  are gazing at stars." </P>

  <P>She went away when the trees were in bud and the spring was young. </P>
  <P>Now the flowers are in high bloom and I call, "Come back, my darling. The
  children gather and scatter flowers in reckless sport. And if you come and
  take one little blossom no one will miss it." </P>

  <P>Those that used to play are playing still, so spendthrift is life. </P>
  <P>I listen to their chatter and call, "Come back, my darling, for mother's
  heart is full to the brim with love, and if you come to snatch only one little
  kiss from her no one will grudge it." </P>

<A name=firstjasmines></A>
  <H2>THE FIRST JASMINES</H2>
  <P class=L>AH, these jasmines, these white jasmines! </P>
  <P>I seem to remember the first day when I filled my hands with these
  jasmines, these white jasmines. </P>
  <P>I have loved the sunlight, the sky and the green earth; </P>
  <P>I have heard the liquid murmur of the river through the darkness of
  midnight; </P>
  <P>Autumn sunsets have come to me at the bend of a road in the lonely waste,
  like a bride raising her veil to accept her lover. </P>
  <P>Yet my memory is still sweet with the first white jasmines that I held in
  my hand when I was a child. </P>

  <P>Many a glad day has come in my life, and I have laughed
  with merrymakers on festival nights. </P>
  <P>On grey mornings of rain I have crooned many an idle song. </P>
  <P>I have worn round my neck the evening wreath of <I>bakulas</I> woven by the
  hand of love. </P>
  <P>Yet my heart is sweet with the memory of the first fresh jasmines that
  filled my hands when I was a child. </P>

<A name=banyantree></A>
  <H2>THE BANYAN TREE</H2>
  <P class=L>O YOU shaggy-headed banyan tree standing on the bank of the pond,
  have you forgotten the little child, like the birds that have nested in your
  branches and left you? </P>
  <P>Do you not remember how he sat at the window and wondered at the tangle of
  your roots that plunged underground? </P>
  <P>The women would come to fill their jars in the pond, and your huge black
  shadow would wriggle on the water like sleep struggling to wake up. </P>
  <P>Sunlight danced on the ripples like restless tiny shuttles weaving golden
  tapestry. </P>
  <P>Two ducks swam by the weedy margin above their shadows, and the child would
  sit still and think. </P>
  <P>He longed to be the wind and blow through your rustling
  branches, to be your shadow and lengthen with the day on the water, to be a
  bird and perch on your top-most twig, and to float like those ducks among the
  weeds and shadows. </P>

  <P class=L>BLESS this little heart, this white soul that has won the kiss of

  <P>He loves the light of the sun, he loves the sight of his mother's face.
</P>
  <P>He has not learned to despise the dust, and to hanker after gold. </P>
  <P>Clasp him to your heart and bless him. </P>
  <P>He has come into this land of an hundred cross-roads. </P>
  <P>I know not how he chose you from the crowd, came to your door, and grasped
  your hand to ask his way. </P>
  <P>He will follow you, laughing and talking, and not a doubt in his heart.
</P>
  <P>Keep his trust, lead him straight and bless him. </P>
  <P>Lay your hand on his head, and pray that though the waves underneath grow
  threatening, yet the breath from above may come and fill his sails and waft
  him to the haven of peace. </P>
  <P>Forget him not in your hurry, let him come to your heart and bless him.

  <H2>THE GIFT</H2>
  <P class=L>I WANT to give you something, my child, for we are drifting in the
  stream of the world. </P>
  <P>Our lives will be carried apart, and our love forgotten. </P>
  <P>But I am not so foolish as to hope that I could buy your heart with my
  gifts. </P>
  <P>Young is your life, your path long, and you drink the love we bring you at
  one draught and turn and run away from us. </P>
  <P>You have your play and your playmates. What harm is there if you have no
  time or thought for us. </P>
  <P>We, indeed, have leisure enough in old age to count the days that are past,
  to cherish in our hearts what our hands have lost for ever. </P>
  <P>The river runs swift with a song, breaking through all barriers. But the
  mountain stays and remembers, and follows her with his love. </P>

<A name=mysong></A>
  <H2>MY SONG</H2>
  <P class=L>THIS song of mine will wind its music around you, my child, like
  the fond arms of love. </P>
  <P>This song of mine will touch your forehead like a kiss of blessing. </P>
  <P>When you are alone it will sit by your side and whisper in your ear, when
  you are in the crowd it will fence you about with aloofness. </P>
  <P>My song will be like a pair of wings to your dreams, it will transport your
  heart to the verge of the unknown. </P>
  <P>It will be like the faithful star overhead when dark night is over your
  road. </P>
  <P>My song will sit inthe pupils of your eyes, and will carry your sight into
  the heart of things. </P>
  <P>And when my voice is silent in death, my song will speak in your living
  heart. </P>

<A name=childangel></A>
  <H2>THE CHILD-ANGEL</H2>
  <P class=L>THEY clamour and fight, they doubt and despair, they know no end to
  their wranglings. </P>
  <P>Let your life come amongst them like a flame of light, my child,
  unflickering and pure, and delight them into silence. </P>
  <P>They are cruel in their greed and their envy, their words are like hidden
  knives thirsting for blood. </P>
  <P>Go and stand amidst their scowling hearts, my child, and let your gentle
  eyes fall upon them like the forgiving peace of the evening over the strife of
  the day. </P>
  <P>Let them see your face, my child, and thus know the meaning of all things;
  let them love you and thus love each other. </P>
  <P>Come and take your seat in the bosom of the limitless, my
  child. At sunrise open and raise your heart like a blossoming flower, and at
  sunset bend your head and in silence complete the worship of the day. </P>

  <H2>THE LAST BARGAIN</H2>
  <P class=L>"COME and hire me," I cried, while in the morning I was walking on
  the stone-paved road. </P>
  <P>Sword in hand, the King came in his chariot. </P>
  <P>He held my hand and said, "I will hire you with my power." </P>
  <P>But his power counted for nought, and he went away in his chariot. </P>

  <P>In the heat of the midday the houses stood with shut doors. </P>
  <P>I wandered along the crooked lane. </P>
  <P>An old man came out with his bag of gold. </P>
  <P>He pondered and said, "I will hire you with my money." </P>
  <P>He weighed his coins one by one, but I turned away. </P>

  <P>It was evening. The garden hedge was all aflower. </P>
  <P>The fair maid came out and said, "I will hire you with a smile." </P>
  <P>Her smile paled and melted into tears, and she went back alone into the
  dark. </P>

  <P>The sun glistened on the sand, and the sea waves broke waywardly. </P>
  <P>A child sat playing with shells. </P>
  <P>He raised his head and seemed to know me, and said, "I hire you with
  nothing." </P>
  <P>From thenceforward that bargain struck in child's play made me a free man.

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To

particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
